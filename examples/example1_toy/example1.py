# The last "transform" doesn't actually modify the data, it just runs incoherent dedispersion.
# You'll need to create the config file with: 'bonsai-mkweight bonsai_config.txt'
# Coarse-grained triggers are written to 'triggers.hdf5', which can be plotted with 'bonsai-plot-triggers.py triggers.hdf5'.
# You'll see some wide diagonal stripes from the toy_transform output, plus a sharply peaked bowtie from the FRB.
#
# Note: the optional arugment 'nt_per_file' to rf_pipelines.bonsai_dedisperser() can be used to break the bonsai output
# into multiple files.  This can make the bonsai output files easier to interpret by putting them in 1-1 correspondence
# with the intensity waterfall plots.  See example3_chime for an explicit example.
