# Some notes on plotter json output:
#
#   - Each transform which outputs plots can emit one or more "plot groups"
#   - The meaning of a plot group is transform-dependent, e.g. for the plotter_transform each group represents a zoom level
#   - The files in each plot_group are divided into "substreams", although we currently don't use this feature,
#     so the substream list always has length-1.  (but this may change in the future)
#   - Each substream within a plot_group consists of a list of files


plot_groups = {

    "name": currently either "waterfall" or "bonsai_tree"
    "nt_per_pix": gives the number of time samples (not seconds) per x-pixel in the plots
    "ny": gives the number of y-pixels in the plots (assumed to be the same for all plots in the group)
    "files" : [ list of plot_substreams ]
}

plot_substreams = [ list of plot_files ]

plot_file = {
    "filename": plot filename relative to directory containing the json file
    "it0": sample index (not timestamp in seconds) of first plotted sample
    "nx": number of x-pixels in plot
