    This transform removes a degree-d weighted-fit legendre

    where w_i, y_i, and f(x_i) are the weights, intensity and model 
    values of sample i, respectively.

      'nt_chunk=1024' is the buffer size.

      'test=False' enables a test mode

      'epsilon' is ignored in the python reference implementation, but is included
