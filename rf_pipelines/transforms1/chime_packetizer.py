    Returns a pseudo-transform which packetizes the stream without modifying it.  The chime_packetizer
    can be inserted anywhere in the pipeline, and will packetize the data as processed up to that point.

    This interface to the CHIME networking code is less general than the low-level C++ interface in
    ch_frb_io: only one beam can be sent, and not all boolean options are supported.

    Some artificial restrictions: the stream 'nfreq' value must be a multiple of 1024, and
    the stream 'dt_sample' value must be an integer multiple of 2.56e-6 seconds.  This is because
    the packet protocol doesn't include a count of total frequency channels, or the fpga clock
    rate, so these parameters are frozen to the CHIME instrumental values.

    The 'dstname' argument is a string of the form HOSTNAME:PORT.  For example 'localhost:13178' or
    'chimer.physics.ubc.ca:13178'.  (Be careful sending packets over the internet since the bandwidth
    can be very high!)

    The 'wt_cutoff' argument is used to convert the rf_pipelines 'weights' array to a boolean mask.
    This conversion is necessary because the CHIME L0_L1 packet format doesn't support a floating-point
    weight array.  Samples with weight below the cutoff will be masked.

    If the 'target_gbps' argument is nonzero, then output will be "throttled" to the target bandwidth, specified
    in Gbps.  If target_gbps=0, then packets will be sent as quickly as possible.

    The nfreq_coarse_per_packet, nt_per_packet arguments define the amount of data sent per packet.
    The nt_per_chunk arg just determines an internal chunk size and isn't very important (must be
    a multiple of nt_per_packet; suggest a value like 512).
