    This transform sets bad freq channels of a weights array to 0.

    Constructor syntax:

      t = badchannel_mask(maskpath=None, nt_chunk=1024, mask=None)

      'maskpath=None' is the full path to a mask file that contains affected freq 
       intervals, written in rows with the following format: e.g., 420.02,423.03

      'nt_chunk=1024' is the buffer size, which is allowed to have a different 
       value in a chain of transforms.

      'mask=None' is a list of user-supplied freq pairs for (additional) masking.
