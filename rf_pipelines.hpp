// rf_pipelines: plugin-based radio astronomy pipelines.
//
// Note: This code is best "documented by example", so if you're seeing it for the first
// time, I recommend starting with the example programs in the examples/ directory!
//
// Warning: currently, the C++ and python API's are pretty well documented, so if you're
// sticking to one or the other then the code should look reasonable.  However, if
// you want to python-wrap a class written in C++, then you'll find that the code in 
// rf_pipelines/rf_pipelines_c.cpp is kind of a mess!  I hope to improve this soon.
// In the meantime, if you want to python-wrap a C++ class, just email me and I'll help
// navigate the mess!
//
// There are two fundamental classes, wi_streams ("weighted intensity stream")
// and wi_transforms ("weighted intensity transform").  These are both virtual
// base classes, with various subclasses defined.  For example, there are
// subclasses of wi_stream to simulate data, read captured data from files,
// or capture real-time data from the network.
//
// A wi_stream incrementally generates chunks of intensity data which is channelized,
// meaning that the data lives in a (freq channel, time sample) 2D array, and weighted,
// meaning that there is a parallel array of floating-point weights.
//
// A wi_transform operates on weighted intensity data, modifying it in place.  For
// example, a detrender or an RFI removal stage could be a wi_transform.  There are
// also pseudo-transforms which process the data without actually modifying it, for
// example plotters or dedispersers.  Transforms run in sequence: each transform's
// output is the input to the next transform.
//
// A generally important thing to be aware of!  Throughout rf_pipelines, we always
// use a frequency channel ordering which goes from highest frequency to lowest.
// This is the same ordering used in the CHIME data and in the bonsai code.
// If you're writing a stream or transform class which "naturally" uses the 
// opposite ordering, then you'll need to do some indexology to translate when
// reading and writing from the rf_pipelines arrays.
//
// Here is a list of the streams and transforms which are currently available in C++.
// More transforms are available in python (see rf_pipelines module docstring for details).
// The python transforms are intended for rapid prototyping and should eventually be 
// translated to C++ for speed.
//

//   make_chime_stream_from_filename()
//   make_chime_stream_from_filename_list()
//   make_gaussian_noise_stream()

    // The 'intensityp' and 'weightp' args will be initialized to bare pointers inside the ring buffers.
    // These are logical arrays of shape (nfreq, nt) but the memory layout is non-contiguous: consecutive
    // time indices are adjacent in memory, but consecutive frequencies are separated by a large offset.

    // can be inferred from the substream start time, the value of wi_stream::dt_sample, and the number of
    // samples written so far.  However, it may be useful to specify t0 occasionally in order to keep track
    // of slow timestamp drifts over time.  For example in the chimefrb pipeline, the intensity samples 
    // always correspond to a fixed number of FPGA counts, and the FPGA clock drifts on long timescales.
