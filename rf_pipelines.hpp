// Note: This code is best "documented by example", so if you're seeing it for the first
// time, I recommend starting with the example programs in the examples/ directory!
//
// Warning: currently, the C++ and python API's are pretty well documented, so if you're
// sticking to one or the other then the code should look reasonable.  However, if
// you want to python-wrap a class written in C++, then you'll find that the code in

//
// There are two fundamental classes, wi_streams ("weighted intensity stream")
// and wi_transforms ("weighted intensity transform").  These are both virtual
// base classes, with various subclasses defined.  For example, there are
// subclasses of wi_stream to simulate data, read captured data from files,
// or capture real-time data from the network.
//
// A wi_stream incrementally generates chunks of intensity data which is channelized,
// meaning that the data lives in a (freq channel, time sample) 2D array, and weighted,
// meaning that there is a parallel array of floating-point weights.
//
// A wi_transform operates on weighted intensity data, modifying it in place.  For
// example, a detrender or an RFI removal stage could be a wi_transform.  There are
// also pseudo-transforms which process the data without actually modifying it, for
// example plotters or dedispersers.  Transforms run in sequence: each transform's
// output is the input to the next transform.
//
// A generally important thing to be aware of!  Throughout rf_pipelines, we always
// use a frequency channel ordering which goes from highest frequency to lowest.
// This is the same ordering used in the CHIME data and in the bonsai code.
// If you're writing a stream or transform class which "naturally" uses the 
// opposite ordering, then you'll need to do some indexology to translate when
// reading and writing from the rf_pipelines arrays.
//
// Here is a list of the streams and transforms which are currently available in C++.
// More transforms are available in python (see rf_pipelines module docstring for details).
// The python transforms are intended for rapid prototyping and should eventually be 
// translated to C++ for speed.
//
// Factory functions which return streams (std::shared_ptr<wi_stream>):
//
//   make_psrfits_stream(f)        -> reads data from psrfits file (e.g. GBNCC data)
//   make_chime_stream()           -> reads data from file in CHIME hdf5 format
//   make_gaussian_noise_stream()  -> outputs gaussian random data
//
// Factory functions which return transforms (std::shared_ptr<wi_transform>):
//
//   make_simple_detreneder()
//      -> a really boneheaded detrending transform which just subtracts the mean in chunks
//   make_chime_file_writer()
//      -> writes stream to a single file in CHIME hdf5 format
//   make_bonsai_dedisperser() 
//      -> runs data through the bonsai dedisperser (dedispersion output is written to an hdf5 file)
