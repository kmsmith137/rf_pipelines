# This is a simple bonsai paramfile for CHIME.
#
# Since it assumes 1024 frequency channels (rather than 16K) the
# computational cost is much lower than what we expect on the real
# L1 node.
#
# The search uses three 4K-trees:
#   - one upsampled (nups=2, max DM 138)
#   - one at native resolution (max DM 276)
#   - one downsampled (nups=2, max DM 552)
#
# Currently the bonsai dedisperser requires its config.txt file to
# be processed into a config.hdf5 file (containing a binary array of
# trigger variances).  Furthermore the output triggers won't be correctly 
# normalized to "sigmas".  This is because triggers variance estimation is 
# currently unimplemented in bonsai.  I plan to fix this soon!  In the
# meantime, you'll need to make the hdf5 file with:
#
#   bonsai-mkweight bonsai_config.txt bonsai_config.hdf5
